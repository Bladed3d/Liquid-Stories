  Instructions for New Claude: Create Project from Template

  I want to create a new project using the multi-agent template.

  PROJECT DETAILS:
  - Name: [YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]
  - Location: D:\Projects\Ai\[YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]
  - Tech Stack: [UNKNOWN YET / To be determined / OR specify if known]

  STEPS:

  1. COPY TEMPLATE
     - Copy D:\Projects\Ai\.claude-project-template to new location
     - Rename to [YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]

  2. MINIMAL CLAUDE.md CUSTOMIZATION
     - Read CLAUDE.md.template
     - Replace {{PROJECT_NAME}} with actual project name
     - For LED ranges: Use {{LED_RANGE_START}} = 10000 (we'll define ranges as we build)
     - For tech stack: If unknown, use: "Tech stack: To be determined during development"
     - Save as CLAUDE.md

     NOTE: We can update these details later as the project evolves!

  3. KEEP QUICK-REFERENCE.md GENERIC
     - The template QUICK-REFERENCE.md already has generic examples
     - Works with any tech stack (npm/python/cargo examples included)
     - We'll customize LED ranges as we identify operation categories

  4. VERIFY AGENT SYSTEM READY
     - Confirm .claude/AGENTS-GUIDE.md exists (340 lines)
     - Confirm .claude/hooks/ has 3 files
     - Confirm .claude/agents/ has 6 agent files

  5. TEST AGENT WORKFLOW
     - Try: "Use developer agent for task-1: Help me decide on tech stack for [project purpose]"
     - The developer agent can HELP choose tech stack through research!
     - OR try: "Use research agent to recommend tech stacks for [project description]"

  6. REPORT READY
     - Confirm template copied and minimally customized
     - Confirm agent system verified
     - Note: Tech stack and LED ranges will be defined as we build

  The agent system works BEFORE you know the tech stack. We can use agents to help
  decide architecture, then update CLAUDE.md and LED ranges later!

  Proceed with step 1.

  What Claude Will Do (Tech Stack Unknown)

  Scenario 1: No Tech Stack Defined Yet

  CLAUDE.md will have:

  ## Project Context
  **Name:** MyNewProject
  **Tech Stack:** To be determined - evaluating options for [web app/CLI tool/API/etc.]
  **Status:** Planning phase

  ## LED Ranges - MyNewProject
  **Note:** Ranges will be defined as architecture emerges during development.
  Placeholder range: 10000-19999 for initial development.

  ## Development Approach
  - Use research agent to evaluate tech stack options
  - Use developer agent for prototyping once stack chosen
  - Update this file as architecture solidifies

  What This Enables:

  1. Agent system works immediately - No tech stack needed to use agents
  2. Research agent can help choose stack - "Use research agent to recommend tech stacks for
  e-commerce site"
  3. LED ranges evolve naturally - As you build features, you'll see what operation categories
  exist
  4. CLAUDE.md grows with project - Living document that gets refined

  ---
  Scenario 2: Project Purpose Known, Stack Unknown

  More specific instructions:

  Create new project from template:

  PROJECT:
  - Name: TaskTrackerPro
  - Purpose: Team task management with real-time updates
  - Tech Stack: UNKNOWN - need to decide between:
    * Next.js + Supabase
    * Django + PostgreSQL + React
    * Rails + Hotwire

  APPROACH:
  1. Copy template to D:\Projects\Ai\TaskTrackerPro
  2. Customize CLAUDE.md with:
     - Name: TaskTrackerPro
     - Purpose: [as above]
     - Tech Stack: "Evaluating options - see tech-stack-decision.md"
     - LED Range Start: 10000 (will refine after architecture chosen)
  3. Create tech-stack-decision.md documenting evaluation criteria
  4. Use research agent: "Research tech stack options for real-time task management"
  5. After stack chosen: Update CLAUDE.md and define proper LED ranges

  Proceed - the agent system will help us make architecture decisions!

  Benefits of "Unknown Stack" Approach

  Agents Can Help You Decide:

  User: "Use research agent to recommend tech stacks for [project type]"
           ↓
  Research Agent: Provides 3-5 options with pros/cons
           ↓
  User: "Use research agent to deep-dive on [chosen option]"
           ↓
  Research Agent: Provides implementation patterns, gotchas, examples
           ↓
  User: "Use developer agent for task-1: Set up [chosen stack] project structure"
           ↓
  Developer Agent: Creates initial project files

  LED Ranges Emerge Naturally:

  As you build, you'll discover your operation categories:
  - First API call → Realize you need LED range for "External APIs"
  - First database query → Realize you need LED range for "Database"
  - First auth flow → Realize you need LED range for "Authentication"

  Then update QUICK-REFERENCE.md with actual ranges based on what you're building.

  Recommended Workflow for New Projects

  Phase 1: Template Setup (5 minutes)

  1. Copy template
  2. Minimal CLAUDE.md customization (name + "stack TBD")
  3. Verify agent system ready

  Phase 2: Architecture Decisions (with agents!)

  4. Use research agent to evaluate tech stack options
  5. Use research agent to research architecture patterns
  6. Document decisions in project files

  Phase 3: Build Begins

  7. Update CLAUDE.md with chosen stack
  8. Use developer agent for initial setup
  9. Define LED ranges as operation categories emerge
  10. Update QUICK-REFERENCE.md with actual ranges

  Phase 4: Ongoing Development

  11. Use developer + quality agent workflow for all features
  12. Refine LED ranges as architecture solidifies
  13. Update CLAUDE.md as patterns emerge

  Updated Simple Instructions

  Here's the simplest version:

  Create new project from template:

  Name: [PROJECT_NAME]
  Purpose: [Brief description]
  Tech Stack: Unknown yet

  Steps:
  1. Copy D:\Projects\Ai\.claude-project-template → D:\Projects\Ai\[PROJECT_NAME]
  2. Edit CLAUDE.md.template:
     - Replace {{PROJECT_NAME}} → actual name
     - Replace tech stack section → "To be determined"
     - Replace LED ranges → "Will define as architecture emerges (starting at 10000)"
     - Save as CLAUDE.md
  3. Verify: Read .claude/AGENTS-GUIDE.md to confirm agent system ready
  4. First task: "Use research agent to recommend tech stacks for [project purpose]"

  The agent system works NOW. We'll define specifics as we build!

  Key Insight

  The template doesn't need tech stack to be functional!

  - ✅ Agent system works with generic setup
  - ✅ Research agent can HELP choose stack
  - ✅ LED ranges can start generic (10000-19999)
  - ✅ Everything gets refined as you build
  - ✅ CLAUDE.md is a living document

  Think of it as: Template provides the scaffolding, agents help you build the house, and you
  document it as you go!

    Quick Verification Command

  After setup, verify everything with:

  Verify the agent system is ready:
  1. Read .claude/AGENTS-GUIDE.md and confirm it exists
  2. List files in .claude/hooks/ and confirm 3 hook files present
  3. List files in .claude/agents/ and confirm 6+ agent files present
  4. Try: "Use developer agent for task-1: Create a test file"
  5. Confirm developer agent responds with structured report

  If all 5 checks pass, project is ready!
