## Lesson 004: Asking

**What You Were Taught:**

Questions show weakness. "I don't know" sounds vulnerable. Leaders should have answers, not questions. You've spent your life believing that having the answer is what matters.

**This Is Only The Beginning.**

---

**What Is True:**

If you want better answers, **ask better questions**.

The question creates the vacuum that the Universe fills.

---

**The Problem With Your Questions:**

Most people ask weak questions.

"How do I become successful?" — Too vague. The Universe can't fill a vacuum that large.

"Why is this happening to me?" — Victim question. You've given your power away.

"How can I fix this?" — Assumes something is broken. Creates a reality of problems.

These questions are plastic seeds — nothing grows from them.

---

**The Better Question:**

When you face a challenge, pause.

Ask yourself: **"What is the BETTER QUESTION here?"**

Not: "Why is this happening to me?"
Instead: "What is this teaching me that I'm ready to learn?"

Not: "How do I fix this?"
Instead: "What wants to emerge through this?"

Not: "What should I do?"
Instead: "What's really bothering me underneath all this?"

The question creates the vacuum. The answer will come.

---

**The Transformation:**

"I don't know" becomes **"I don't know yet, and I am opening myself to receive."**

The first is a wall. The second is a door.

---

**When Do The Best Questions Arise?**

I'll be vulnerable with you — I used to ask terrible questions.

I spent years asking "Why me?" when things went wrong. I asked "How can I make him proud?" when I should have been asking "What do I value regardless of anyone's approval?"

I was a **slow learner** about this.

The best questions often come after failure. When your ego has been pummeled. When appearing smart no longer matters. When the desire to understand truth is greater than the desire to be right.

**THAT** is when the best questions finally materialize.

---

**The Fear:**

You might be afraid to ask. Afraid of looking ignorant. Afraid of appearing weak.

Your ego will protect itself by:
- Pretending to know
- Avoiding asking altogether
- Asking without sincerity

Let it go. The question is more powerful than the appearance of knowing.

Better to ask sincerely and receive truth than to pretend to know and live in illusion.

---

**The Sincere Question:**

What makes a question sincere?

**You contribute first.**

You've done your own thinking. You've considered the situation. You offer your partial understanding — then you open to receive more.

Insincere questions offer nothing. They steal from others. They demand answers without doing the work.

Sincere questions contribute first, then receive. They are living seeds — truth emerges from them.

---

**The Practice:**

When you face a challenge:

1. **Pause** — Don't react immediately
2. **Ask yourself**: "What is the BETTER QUESTION here?"
3. **Listen** — The answer will come through the vacuum you've created

The question is more powerful than the answer.

---

**The Character Quality:**

Asking is not just a technique. It's who you **become**.

Someone who can ask without pretense. Without ego. Without the need to appear knowledgeable.

Someone who holds out their cup — empty, open, ready — and trusts that truth will fill it.

**You teach best that which you need to learn most.**

I don't write to teach you. I write to learn.

And right now, I'm learning that the question — the sincere, vulnerable, precise question — is the beginning of every answer.

The question creates the vacuum.

The Universe fills it.
