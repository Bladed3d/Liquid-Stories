## The LED Breadcrumbs System

### What Are LED Breadcrumbs?

Execution trail markers that create a log showing exactly what your code did:

```
✅ LED {{LED_RANGE_START}}00: user_clicked_button [ComponentName]
✅ LED {{LED_RANGE_START}}10: api_call_started [ComponentName] {"endpoint":"/api/endpoint"}
❌ LED {{LED_RANGE_START}}12 FAILED [ComponentName]: api_timeout - Request took 5000ms
```

**Why they matter:**
- AI agents can read structured logs and debug precisely
- 3-hour debugging sessions reduced to 5 minutes
- "Where did it fail?" answered instantly

### The Two Breakthroughs

**See `Docs/SYSTEM-BREAKTHROUGHS.md` for the full story**

**Breakthrough #1: Agent Task Confirmation**
- Agent confirms understanding before starting
- Creates memory checkpoint that persists
- Saves 90% of tokens (no re-explaining)
- Prevents Claude from forgetting the process

**Breakthrough #2: Test Validation**
- 3 hours wasted debugging perfect code with wrong tests
- Test-creation agent verifies selectors exist before writing tests
- Tests can never succeed → Tests that actually work

---

## Development Workflow

### For Code Development

**Use the agent-based workflow:**

```
Use developer agent for task-XXX
  ↓
Developer: "I understand. I will: [confirmation]"
  ↓
Developer: [Implements with LED breadcrumbs + tests]
  ↓
Developer: "Done. RAW proof: [test output]"
  ↓
Use quality agent to verify task-XXX
  ↓
Quality: [Verifies independently] → APPROVED / NEEDS_FIX
  ↓
Main Claude: [Spot-checks both reports]
  ↓
Approve to user if verified ✅
```

### For Documentation

**Standard development process:**

1. **Research** - WebSearch/WebFetch for similar docs
2. **Write** - Create/edit documentation
3. **Review** - Check for clarity and completeness
4. **Commit** - Save with clear message

**No tests needed** for documentation (unless writing code examples).

## LED Ranges for {{PROJECT_NAME}}

### How to Define Your LED Ranges

**LED ranges categorize the OPERATIONS that happen in YOUR project.**

**Process:**

1. **List the actual operations in your project**
   - What does your code DO?
   - What are the main workflows?
   - What could fail that you'd need to debug?

2. **Group related operations**
   - Operations that happen together
   - Similar types of actions
   - Logical debugging categories

3. **Assign ranges to each group**
   - Use consistent numbering (e.g., 1000s blocks)
   - Make them memorable and meaningful

### Reference Examples

**DebugLayer (Website):** 30000-39999
- 30000-30099: Page lifecycle (mount, hydration, unmount)
- 30100-30199: User interactions (clicks, inputs, navigation)
- 30200-30299: API calls (requests, responses, caching)
- 30300-30399: Component rendering (state, props, effects)
- 30400-30499: Form submissions (validation, errors)

**VoiceCoach-v2 (Complex Project):** See D:\Projects\Ai\VoiceCoach-v2
- Study this for a real-world example with many operations
- Notice how ranges reflect actual workflows
- Use as inspiration for organizing YOUR operations

### Your {{PROJECT_NAME}} LED Ranges

**Define based on YOUR project's actual operations:**

Example starting point (customize these!):

- **[Range]**: [What operation? e.g., User authentication flow]
- **[Range]**: [What operation? e.g., Database queries]
- **[Range]**: [What operation? e.g., API request handling]
- **[Range]**: [What operation? e.g., Data processing pipeline]
- **[Range]**: [What operation? e.g., File upload/download]
- **[Range]**: [What operation? e.g., Background jobs]
- **[Range]**: [What operation? e.g., Real-time updates]
- **[Range]**: [What operation? e.g., Error handling]

**Note:** The numbers don't matter. What matters is that they organize YOUR operations in a way that makes debugging easier.

### LED Range Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Define ranges based on actual operations in your code
- Use ranges that make debugging easier
- Group related operations together
- Look at other projects for organizational ideas

❌ **DON'T:**
- Copy ranges from other projects without thinking
- Use generic categories that don't match your operations
- Assign ranges before understanding your workflows

## The Agent Team

### Core Development Agents

**Developer Agent** (Sonnet)
- Implements features with LED breadcrumbs
- Writes Playwright tests (for UI) or unit tests
- **Critical feature:** Task confirmation before starting
- Provides RAW test output as proof

**Quality Agent** (Haiku)
- Independent verification (doesn't trust developer)
- Re-runs tests independently
- Compares results
- Reports: APPROVED / NEEDS_FIX / ESCALATE

**Test-Creation Agent** (Sonnet)
- Testing specialist
- **Never invents selectors** - always verifies they exist
- Prevents the 3-hour test crisis
- Writes tests that can actually succeed

### Support Agents

**Research Agent** (Sonnet)
- Finds proven solutions when stuck
- Provides 3-5 approaches with pros/cons
- Time limit: 15 minutes

**Debugger Agent** (Sonnet)
- Root cause analysis from LED logs
- Diagnoses but doesn't fix
- Time limit: 15 minutes

**Environment Agent** (Haiku)
- Configuration troubleshooting
- Dependencies, .env issues
- Time limit: 15 minutes

**See:** `.claude/agents/*.md` for complete specifications

---

## Common Tasks

### Development

```bash
# Use developer agent for complex features
Use developer agent for task-123

# Follow with quality verification
Use quality agent to verify task-123
```

**Remember:**
- Developer confirms understanding first (memory lock!)
- Developer provides RAW test proof
- Quality verifies independently
- Main Claude spot-checks before approving

### Testing

**MANDATORY: All code must have appropriate tests**

```bash
# Run tests
[your test command here]

# Debug failed tests
cat breadcrumb-debug.log

# Filter for errors
grep "❌" breadcrumb-debug.log
```

**Never report feature complete without passing tests.**

---

## Security & Best Practices

### API Key Protection

```typescript
// ✅ Safe
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
if (!apiKey) {
  throw new Error("API_KEY not found in .env");
}

// ❌ Never
const apiKey = "hardcoded-key-here";  // DON'T DO THIS!
```

### LED Logging Safety

```typescript
// ✅ Safe
trail.light(LED_RANGES.AUTH.LOGIN, 'login_attempt', {
  email: user.email
});

// ❌ Never log sensitive data
trail.light(LED_RANGES.AUTH.LOGIN, 'login_attempt', {
  email: user.email,
  password: user.password  // NEVER LOG PASSWORDS!
});
```

### File Naming

**Always use hyphens:**

```bash
# ✅ Correct
my-component.tsx
user-profile.ts

# ❌ Wrong
my_component.tsx
userProfile.ts
```

---

## Git Workflow

### Commit Messages

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Brief title describing the change

- Bullet point of what changed
- Another detail if needed

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

### What to Commit

**Always commit:**
- Source code
- Documentation
- Configuration files
- Examples

**Never commit:**
- `.env` files
- API keys
- `node_modules/` or similar dependency directories
- Log files (`breadcrumb-debug.log`)
- Session files

---

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Development
[your dev commands here]

# Testing
[your test commands here]

# Debugging
cat breadcrumb-debug.log              # View all LEDs
grep "❌" breadcrumb-debug.log        # Errors only
grep "LED {{LED_RANGE_START}}2" breadcrumb-debug.log   # Specific category

# Agent workflow
Use developer agent for task-XXX      # Implement
Use quality agent to verify task-XXX   # Verify
Use test-creation agent for tests      # When tests needed
```

---

## Success Criteria

### You're doing it right when:

- ✅ Agents confirm understanding before starting
- ✅ All code has LED breadcrumbs at key points
- ✅ Tests verify tests (no invented selectors!)
- ✅ Quality agent catches developer mistakes
- ✅ User only sees working features
- ✅ Documentation is clear and helpful

### You're doing it wrong when:

- ❌ Skipping agent confirmation
- ❌ Trusting test reports without verification
- ❌ Writing tests without verifying selectors
- ❌ Asking user to test your code
- ❌ Debugging working code with wrong tests
- ❌ Over-complicating simple tasks

---

## Remember

> **"LED Breadcrumbs + AI Agent Teams = Self-healing development that never wastes your time"**

**Two innovations make this work:**
1. Agent task confirmation (prevents memory loss)
2. Test validation (prevents impossible tests)

**Three verification layers ensure quality:**
1. Developer tests with LEDs
2. Quality verifies independently
3. Main Claude spot-checks proof

**Result:** Development that actually works.
