# V4 - Simple Modular Plan

## 🎯 Goal
Take working V3 and organize code into clean modules.

## ✅ Requirements
1. Keep V3 exactly as it is (working baseline)
2. Create V4 that looks/works exactly like V3
3. Split V4 code into logical modules
4. No servers, no npm, no complexity

## 📁 Structure
```
HtmlTests/
├── 2image-liquid-paint-v3.html (working - DON'T TOUCH)
├── 2image-liquid-paint-v4.html (new modular version)
└── modules/
    ├── particles.js (particle system)
    ├── images.js (image loading/display)
    ├── interaction.js (mouse/touch)
    └── story.js (story progression)
```

## 🧪 Test Method
1. Open V3 and V4 in browser tabs
2. They should look identical
3. They should work identical
4. If not, V4 is broken

## 🚫 No Complexity
- No servers
- No npm packages
- No testing frameworks
- No LED systems
- No over-engineering

Just clean code organization.
