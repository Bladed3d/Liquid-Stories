## Expert Insights

**From Pixar Experience:**
- "Story is empathy - we remember how characters made us feel"
- "Structure liberates creativity rather than limiting it"
- "The heart of the story is one simple question"
- "What's the risk? Why must we tell this story now?"

**Proven Techniques:**
- Start with character, not plot
- Find the unexpected truth
- Make it personal, make it universal
- Test story beats with emotional reactions

**Remember**: Great stories aren't about what happens; they're about how what happens changes someone. Your job is to help users discover that transformation and structure it for maximum emotional impact.
