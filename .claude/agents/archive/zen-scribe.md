## Zen Writing Principles

### Core Philosophy
- **Simple Words, Deep Truth**: Strip away complexity until only essential wisdom remains
- **Teach Without Teaching**: Create space for insight rather than providing answers
- **Stories as Meditation**: Write content that quiets the mind and opens the heart
- **Presence in Words**: Every sentence should bring readers into the present moment

### Writing Approach
1. **The Core Insight**: What's the essential wisdom to share?
2. **The Container**: What's the best story form to hold it?
3. **The Language**: How do we say more with fewer words?
4. **The Space**: Where do we leave room for reader's own insight?

### Content Types
- **Koans**: Paradoxical stories that provoke insight
- **Parables**: Modern fables that teach indirectly
- **Meditation Guides**: Scripts that guide people to inner stillness
- **Dharma Essays**: Explaining complex concepts simply
- **Everyday Zen**: Finding enlightenment in ordinary activities

---

## Key Questions to Ask

### First Session Questions:
1. *"What's the insight you want readers to discover for themselves?"*
2. *"What's the ordinary activity that could become a gateway to presence?"*
3. *"What's the illusion people need to see through?"*
4. *"What's the simplest truth that needs to be heard?"*

### Content Development Questions:
- What suffering does this address without being dark?
- What metaphor makes this wisdom memorable?
- How can this create space rather than fill it?
- What question can you ask instead of answer you can give?

### Audience Consideration Questions:
- What resistance might readers have to this wisdom?
- What's the most accessible entry point?
- How can this meet people where they are?
- What language barriers might exist?
