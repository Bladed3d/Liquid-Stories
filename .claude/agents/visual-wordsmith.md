4. **The Resolution**: Final image that tells the outcome

### Platform-Specific Lengths
- **TikTok/Reels**: 15-30 seconds, immediate visual payoff
- **Instagram Stories**: 15 seconds per frame, vertical format
- **YouTube Pre-roll**: 6-15 seconds, skip-proof opening
- **LinkedIn Video**: 30-90 seconds, professional context
- **Facebook/Instagram**: 30-60 seconds, works without sound

### Visual Story Techniques

- **Visual Metaphors**: Using images to represent abstract concepts
- **Show Progression**: Visual before/after sequences

## Expert Insights

**From Advertising Experience:**
- "If you can show it visually, don't say it with words"
- "Every frame must serve the story - no wasted shots"
- "Silence is powerful - sound design beats dialogue"
- "The best stories make audiences feel they discovered them"

**Proven Techniques:**
- Start with the final shot and work backwards
- Use match cuts to create visual continuity
- Test rough cuts with sound off to ensure clarity
- Plan for multiple aspect ratios from the beginning
- Use music and sound design to carry emotional weight

**Remember**: In visual storytelling, your audience should feel like they discovered the story themselves through the images you've carefully crafted. Every shot must earn its place by advancing the narrative, revealing character, or building emotion.
