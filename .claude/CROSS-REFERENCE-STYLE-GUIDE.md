# Cross-Reference Style Guide

**Purpose**: Guide for embedding cross-references between lessons in the "2 Minutes to HOOT" series

---

## Two Types of Cross-References

### 1. Embedded References (In-Lesson Context)

**When to Use:**
- Concept overlaps with previous lesson (detected in Search 3 with >0.75 similarity)
- Reader benefits from deeper explanation
- Reference adds genuine value without derailing flow
- Max 1-2 embedded references per lesson

**Format:**
```markdown
[Core concept statement] — **[Connection to lesson]**

**Brief explanation**: 1-2 sentences explaining the connection
```

**Example from Lesson 004:**
> Sometimes the answer flows from you. Frequently the answer flows **through you** — not generated by your mind, but received as a vessel.
>
> *(This is the mechanism from **Truth Flows Through You** — Lesson 002 explains how truth moves through rather than from you.)*

**Key Principles:**
- Keep it brief (1-2 sentences maximum)
- Use lesson name and number
- Don't over-reference (1-2 per lesson is plenty)
- Reference only when genuinely helpful for understanding
- Validate with Search 3: ensure strong overlap (>0.75 similarity) exists

**Good Reference Example:**
> "This is not passive. This is **profoundly active** — the recognition that truth arrives through you, not from you. *(As you learned in **Truth Flows Through You** — Lesson 002 — this is the mechanism of accessing higher intelligence.)*"

**Why it works:**
- Strong overlap detected in Search 3
- Adds value by connecting to previous teaching
- Brief (1 sentence)
- Doesn't derail the flow

### 2. Footer References (Summary Metadata)

**Format:**
```markdown
**Related Concepts**: Lesson Name (Lesson ###), Lesson Name (Lesson ###), Lesson Name (Lesson ###)
```

**Example:**
```markdown
**Related Concepts**: Truth First (Lesson 001), Truth Flows Through You (Lesson 002), Empty Cup (Lesson 003)
```

**Purpose:** Quick scan of all related lessons at the end of each lesson

**Rules:**
- Only list lessons that actually exist and are published
- List in numerical order
- Keep format consistent: `**Related Concepts**: Lesson Name (Lesson ###), Lesson Name (Lesson ###)`

## Cross-Reference Detection Process

### During Part 1 (Multi-Source Research):

**Review Search 3 Results:**
1. Note all results with similarity >0.75
2. Identify which previous lessons they connect to
3. Choose 1-2 most valuable connections
4. Validate the connection appears in Derek's writings

**Example Detection for Lesson 004:**

**Search 3 Query:** "truth flows through you vessel conduit not from you"

**Results:**
- Result 1 (similarity 0.497): "TRUTH is a force... It flows to AND from the source"
- Result 4 (similarity 0.416): "Intelligence flows through you, not from you"

**Strong Overlap Detected:**
- Similarity >0.40 (threshold)
- Concept "flows through you" appears
- Connects to Lesson 002 "Truth Flows Through You"

**Decision:** Add embedded reference when discussing "answer flows through you" mechanism in Lesson 004

---

## When NOT to Add Cross-References

**Avoid cross-references when:**

1. **Weak connection** (similarity <0.50)
   - Only mention if genuinely relevant
   - Don't force connections

2. **Forced fit** (doesn't flow naturally)
   - If it feels jammed in, leave it out
   - The reference should feel organic

3. **Over-referencing** (more than 2 per lesson)
   - Too many references clutter the lesson
   - Reader loses track

4. **No value added**
   - If the reference doesn't help understanding
   - If it's just for the sake of connecting

## Future Enhancement: Ebook Links

**When ebook platform is ready**, replace text references with clickable markdown links:

**Current (text-only):**
> ...flows **through you** — not generated by your mind, but received as a vessel.
>
> *(This is the mechanism from **Truth Flows Through You** — Lesson 002 explains how truth moves through rather than from you.)*

**Future (clickable links):**
> ...flows **through you** — not generated by your mind, but received as a vessel.
>
> *(See [Lesson 002: Truth Flows Through You](../lesson-002-truth-flows-through-you.md) for the full teaching on this mechanism)*

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use relative paths for ebook compatibility
- Keep lesson name and number for clarity
- Maintain brief explanation format

## Quality Checklist

Before adding an embedded cross-reference, verify:

```
[ ] Search 3 detected strong overlap (>0.75 similarity)
[ ] Connection appears in Derek's writings (validated)
[ ] Reference adds genuine value for understanding
[ ] Flows naturally within the lesson (not forced)
[ ] Keeps to 1-2 sentences maximum
[ ] Lesson being referenced exists and is published
[ ] Not duplicating same connection multiple times
```

## Examples by Lesson Type

### Building on Previous Lesson

**Lesson 005 builds on Lesson 004 (Asking):**
> "Before all else, seek to know the truth. But HOW do you seek it? By asking better questions. *(As you learned in **Asking** — Lesson 004 — the quality of your questions determines the quality of your answers.)*"

### Connecting Foundational Concept

**Lesson connects to Truth First (Lesson 001):**
> "This practice requires sincerity. You must genuinely want truth, not validation. *(This is the foundation from **Truth First** — Lesson 001 — truth must come before everything else.)*"

### Referencing Mechanism

**Lesson references Empty Cup mechanism (Lesson 003):**
> "You must remain teachable. Approach with empty cup, not full cup. *(As explained in **Empty Cup** — Lesson 003 — you cannot fill a cup that's already full.)*"

## Summary

**Embedded References:**
- Max 1-2 per lesson
- Validate with Search 3 (>0.75 similarity)
- Keep brief (1-2 sentences)
- Must add genuine value
- Flow naturally

**Footer References:**
- List all related published lessons
- Numerical order
- Consistent format
- For quick scanning

**Goal:** Create interconnected curriculum where lessons build on each other while each lesson stands alone.
