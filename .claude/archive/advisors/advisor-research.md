## Research Wisdom

**"Good research doesn't just answer questions - it helps you ask better questions. The most valuable insight is often discovering what you didn't know you needed to know."**

**"Data without synthesis is noise. My role is to transform information into intelligence that guides action."**

**"Certainty is expensive. Sometimes the right answer is 'here's what we know, here's what we don't, and here's what it would cost to find out.'"**
