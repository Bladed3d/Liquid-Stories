# Quick Session Start Commands

## Option 1: Full Session Management (Recommended)

```
I want to start an advisor team session. Use your session coordinator instructions in "D:\Projects\Ai\Liquid-Stories\.claude\advisors\session-coordinator.md" to manage my profile and sessions.
```

### What Happens:

**For New Users:**
1. AI asks for your profile name
2. Creates your personal profile (8 questions - asked once)
3. Shows a menu to select what you want to work on:
   - Personal Guidance (career, life decisions)
   - New Book Project
   - New Content Series
   - New Project
4. Creates project-specific profile if needed
5. Begins advisor team session

**For Returning Users:**
1. AI asks for your profile name
2. Shows a menu with your options:
   - Personal Guidance
   - Continue Previous Project (lists all your projects with status)
   - New Book Project
   - New Content Series
   - New Project
3. Loads your project and continues from where you left off

## Option 2: Direct Session Start (No profiles/projects)

```
I want to start an advisor team session. Use the instructions in "D:\Projects\Ai\Liquid-Stories\.claude\advisors\TEAM-SESSION-QUICK-START.md" to facilitate a session with the advisors for me.
Note: The What If Explorer (MiniMax model) is available for scenario analysis when needed - it launches automatically when scenarios require analysis.
```

## Option 3: Simple Request

```
Start an advisor team session for me.
```
