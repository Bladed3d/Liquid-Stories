# Quick Reference - {{PROJECT_NAME}}

**Fast lookup for common commands and workflows**

---

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development
[your dev server command]

# Build
[your build command]

# Test
[your test command]

# Test in debug mode
[your debug test command]
```

---

## LED Breadcrumb Debugging

```bash
# View all LEDs
cat breadcrumb-debug.log

# View only errors
grep "❌" breadcrumb-debug.log

# View specific LED range
grep "LED {{LED_RANGE_START}}0" breadcrumb-debug.log    # Category 1
grep "LED {{LED_RANGE_START}}1" breadcrumb-debug.log    # Category 2
grep "LED {{LED_RANGE_START}}2" breadcrumb-debug.log    # Category 3

# View LEDs from specific component

## Agent Workflows

### Standard Development Flow

```
1. Use developer agent for task-XXX
   ↓
2. Developer confirms understanding
   ↓
3. Developer implements + tests
   ↓
4. Developer provides RAW proof
   ↓
5. Use quality agent to verify task-XXX
   ↓
6. Quality verifies independently
   ↓
7. Main Claude approves if verified
```

### Quick Agent Commands

```bash
# Core development
Use developer agent for task-123
Use quality agent to verify task-123
Use test-creation agent for tests

# Support agents (15 min time limit)
Use research agent to find solutions for [problem]
Use debugger agent to analyze [issue]
Use environment agent to fix [config issue]
```

## Git Workflows

### Quick Commit

```bash
git add .
git status
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'

)"
```

### View Recent Changes

```bash
git status              # Current changes

## LED Ranges - {{PROJECT_NAME}}

**Define these based on YOUR project's actual operations!**

Study reference projects for organizational ideas:
- **DebugLayer** (D:\Projects\Ai\DebugLayer)
- **VoiceCoach-v2** (D:\Projects\Ai\VoiceCoach-v2)

**Your {{PROJECT_NAME}} operation categories:**

- **[Range]**: [What operation? e.g., Authentication, Database queries, etc.]
- **[Range]**: [What operation?]
- **[Range]**: [What operation?]
- **[Range]**: [What operation?]
- **[Range]**: [What operation?]
- **[Range]**: [What operation?]
- **[Range]**: [What operation?]
- **[Range]**: [What operation?]

See `CLAUDE.md` for guidance on defining LED ranges.

## Common Issues

### Tests Failing

```bash
# 1. Check LED logs for errors
grep "❌" breadcrumb-debug.log

# 2. Run tests in headed mode
[your debug test command]

# 3. Clear cache and retry
[your cache clear command]
```

### Development Server Issues

```bash
# 1. Check what's running on port
netstat -ano | findstr :[PORT]

# 2. Kill specific process
taskkill /F /PID [PID]

# 3. Clear and restart
[your clean restart commands]
```

### Environment Issues

```bash
# Check environment
node --version
npm --version

# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

---

## File Conventions

**Always use hyphens for multi-word files:**

```bash
# ✅ Correct
my-component.tsx
user-service.ts
api-client.js

# ❌ Wrong
my_component.tsx
userService.ts
```

## Testing Checklist

Before marking feature complete:

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] LED breadcrumbs at key points
- [ ] No errors in breadcrumb-debug.log
- [ ] Quality agent verified
- [ ] Git commit created

---

## Emergency Commands

```bash
# Save work immediately
git add . && git commit -m "WIP: Emergency save"

# See what's uncommitted
git status

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Discard all changes (DANGEROUS!)
git reset --hard HEAD
```
