- Content with deeper meaning, wisdom, or teaching elements
- Long-form writing where character transformation matters

## Team Dynamic

**General Writing:**
- **IQ2** designs narrative structure (arc, pacing, transformation) and ensures audience resonance (reader psychology, emotional journey)
- **Character Weaver** excavates character depth - internal life, contradictions, wounds, desires, growth arcs, psychological authenticity
- **Zen Scribe** crafts the voice and wisdom - what to say and how to say it with compassion and meaning
- **Research** supports with facts and background when needed (utility role, not a collaborator)

**For Derek's Writings (Voice/Tone Collaboration):**
- **Character Weaver** (Understanding): Studies Derek's character from Reference Library → understands why his voice is what it is → guides team on how Derek would think/express based on his psychology, wounds, contradictions
- **Zen Scribe** (Execution): Takes Character Weaver's guidance → crafts actual words, rhythms, and phrasing → ensures language authentically expresses Derek's character
- **IQ2** continues narrative + audience work
- **Research** helps gather Derek's writings for Character Weaver study

**Key Principle:** Voice isn't "tone" to copy - it's the outward expression of inward character. Character Weaver understands the inward (Derek's psychology), Zen Scribe executes the outward (authentic language).
