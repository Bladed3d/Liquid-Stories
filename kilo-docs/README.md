# Kilo Documentation

This directory contains Kilo-specific adaptations of your proven Claude Code development workflow. These documents ensure smooth, consistent development sessions with Kilo while preserving all the quality and verification standards you established.

## Documentation Overview

### [workflow.md](./workflow.md)
**Main workflow guide** - Adapted PM workflow for Kilo's single-agent model
- Complete development process from planning to deployment
- Test-first development with build verification
- Escalation protocols and safety measures
- Kilo-specific optimizations

### [agent-capabilities.md](./agent-capabilities.md)
**Role mapping guide** - How Kilo handles all agent functions
- Task Breakdown → Kilo analysis tools
- Test Agent → Direct Playwright test creation
- Developer Agent → Code editing and implementation
- Quality Agent → Independent verification
- Research Agent → WebFetch integration

### [verification-process.md](./verification-process.md)
**Quality assurance protocols** - Build verification and testing standards
