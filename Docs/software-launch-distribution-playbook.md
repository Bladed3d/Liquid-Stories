# Software Launch Distribution Playbook
## Complete Analysis of Matt Epstein's $70k-$150k Launch Strategy

**Source:** Video transcript interview with Matt Epstein (23, $1M/year agency owner)
**Context:** Behind-the-scenes playbook for launching software products on Twitter/X
**Typical Results:** 2-10M views, demo calendars booked solid for weeks
**Budget Range:** $70k-$150k agency fees + $50k-$100k influencer budget

---

## Executive Summary

Matt Epstein runs an agency that orchestrates viral Twitter launches for software companies, generating 2-10 million views per campaign. His playbook reveals that **distribution is more important than the video itself** - he uses 30-100 paid influencers who post content written by his team, combined with algorithmic manipulation tactics to ensure viral spread.

### Core Philosophy

> "When most people see a launch, they see the main video and think that's it. But really the more important part is the distribution around the video."

The strategy works like a nightclub:
- **Promoters** (paid influencers) bring the crowd
- **Early momentum** signals quality to algorithms
- **Organic amplification** follows once critical mass hits
- **Result**: Platform serves content to millions in target niche

### Key Success Factors

1. **Novel positioning** - "World's first" anything trumps features
2. **Bold defensible claims** - Maximum intensity while still true
3. **Orchestrated amplification** - 30-100 influencers post simultaneously
4. **Algorithm gaming** - Reply to EVERY comment (X algo priority signal)
5. **Lead magnet/giveaway** - Forces engagement (retweet + comment to receive)
6. **Custom content per influencer** - Agency writes ALL influencer posts

---

## 1. Core Strategy Framework

### The Launch-as-Nightclub Analogy

> "I look at a launch like a club. A club will hire promoters. Promoters need to bring hot girls into the club. If the club and the promoters do a good job that night, they'll bring a ton of hot girls. The girls will post on their story. Then guys will come and the club will make a ton of money."

**Translation for launches:**
- Promoters = Paid influencers
- Hot girls = Early engaged audience
- Story posts = Influencer tweets
- Guys showing up = Organic traffic following the crowd
- Club makes money = Product gets demos booked

**Real example (Meridian launch):**
> "We paid the first 50 or 70 people to talk about the launch in the exact way we wanted them to. And then all of a sudden the entire two or three days after the launch, everyone was on the platform talking about it."

### Why This Works

**The biggest misconception about influencer marketing:**
> "Influencers will do a good job selling your product. That is the biggest misconception. Influencers can sell themselves, they can post for themselves, but as soon as you pay them to do something, they give you the biggest load of dog shit."

**The solution:**
- Agency brings in content team
- Team studies each influencer's page
- Team writes content for that influencer's voice
- Team creates visual assets for each post
- Everything is "super tactical" based on already-proven viral posts

---

## 2. Tactical Playbook: Step-by-Step Execution

### Phase 1: Positioning & Script Development (Weeks 1-2)

#### Step 1: Research What People Want

> "The number one step in copywriting is understanding what do people want. What do people out there already want and need and if you can fulfill that need and position your product as the solution to that desire and that need, then you'll do well."

**Action items:**
- Spend 10-20 hours researching what target niche talks about
- Find pain points discussed on Reddit, X, forums
- Identify what's already trending in the space
- Document the "meta" (current hot topics)

**Reality check:**
> "If your product doesn't solve a problem that people on Reddit are already talking about, that people on X are already talking about, then you probably don't have a good product in the first place."

#### Step 2: Craft Novel Positioning

**The positioning test:**
Which sounds more novel?
- ❌ "A tool that helps your brand get ranked better and seen more"
- ✅ "The world's first AI SEO team to get your brand ranked #1 by OpenAI, ChatGPT, Perplexity and DeepSeek"

**Formula:**
- Lead with "World's first" (novelty)
- Include specific outcome (ranked #1)
- Add impressive details (multiple platforms)

**Positioning examples from launches:**

**Slash (banking):**
> "We raised $60 million to build the world's first business banking platform that allows you to open an account without an LLC or an EIN."

**MOI (Triple Whale):**
> "World's first agentic system that can make any brand owner $100,000 in 30 days"

**Key positioning principles:**
1. **Novelty over features** - "World's first X" > "We built Y"
2. **Outcome over process** - "Make $100k" > "Analyzes data"
3. **Defensible boldness** - "How bold can we make a claim that is still defensible?"

#### Step 3: Write Launch Video Script

**Script structure (30-90 seconds):**

**Opening (5-10 seconds):**
- Bold claim with novel positioning
- Include "ammunition" (funding amount, impressive stats)
- State clear outcome for viewer

**Example:**
> "We raised $60 million to build the world's first business banking platform that allows you to open a business banking account without an LLC or an EIN. Let me show you how it works."

**Middle (20-60 seconds):**
- Back up the bold claim immediately
- Show the "wow moments" - spectacular features
- Demonstrate in real-time (not past tense)
- Walk through actual usage

**Critical rules:**
- Show don't tell
- Present tense only ("Right now MOI is scanning...")
- Audio and visual match 1:1 (Mr. Beast principle)
- 5th grade reading level maximum
- If viewer doesn't understand ONE word, they're gone

**Visual production notes:**
> "There's certain areas when you're editing a video... you need to make the video good. Like this computer vision effect that we always add on launch videos when we're talking about the AI scanning something - these red boxes with a plugin. That doesn't actually happen by the way. But you need the visual and the audio to line up one-to-one."

**Optional Middle Section (10-20 seconds):**
- Social proof (for new/unknown brands only)
- How many companies use you
- Who backs you (investors)
- Notable results

**Triple Whale didn't need this** (established authority)
**New founders DO need this** (build credibility)

**Closing (10-15 seconds):**
- Lead magnet offer
- Clear call to action
- Create urgency ("Next 24 hours...")

**Example:**
> "Just for thanking you for watching this video, we want to offer you a free Meridian AI SEO score report. Comment 'Meridian' and retweet this video in the next 24 hours and we'll send it to you."

**Why this works:**
1. Incentivizes retweets (X algo sourcing signal)
2. Incentivizes comments (X algo ranking signal)
3. Captures emails (lead generation)
4. Demonstrates problem (makes them aware)
5. Gets them into funnel

#### Step 4: Create Lead Magnet / Giveaway

**Critical success factor:**
> "Validate that your giveaway is a good giveaway by making sure there's like people do giveaways on LinkedIn and X all the time. Find something out there that's already proven and copy it."

**How to validate:**
1. Search for existing viral giveaways in your niche
2. Find ones with 1000+ comments/engagement
3. Copy the concept exactly
4. Adapt to your product

**Real examples:**

**Meridian (AI SEO tool):**
- Built a free scoring tool
- Users enter domain
- Tool runs prompts through ChatGPT API
- Returns score (0-100) + where they rank
- Shows specific weaknesses
- CTA to sign up for full product
- **Cost them money** but generated massive engagement

**AI Media Buyer in Slack:**
> "This guy on LinkedIn gave away an AI media buyer in Slack. It went nuclear viral like 20,000 comments. We can build our own AI media buyer in Slack. That is a better chance that giveaway is going to do super well because it's already proven."

**Giveaway principles:**
- Must be immediately useful
- Should demonstrate the problem
- Can't require complex setup
- Must have high perceived value
- Should lead naturally to product signup

#### Step 5: Add Rage Bait (Carefully)

> "You are toeing the line with controversy. There's no nuance allowed on Twitter. You have to have bold claims. You need to be polarized. You need to be on the edge of controversy without getting cancelled."

**Real examples:**

**Slash launch:**
> "Slash offers every user regardless of banking size non-Mumbai 24/7 customer support."

**Result:** Levels.io quote retweeted it. Everyone commented "There's no way he just said that." Some Indian people got mad in comments. Massive distribution.

**The strategy:**
> "It's that little subtle thing that you throw in that like almost gets brushed over, but then gets someone to be like 'Wait, was that real? Did he just say that?'"

**Meridian launch:**
> "I wanted to piss off the SEO community purposely. And the reason I wanted to piss off the SEO community is because they're going to start commenting. They're going to start quoting. And it worked. We had hundreds of them raging, getting really upset about it. Little did they realize that they were just distributing the hell out of this post for us."

**Target easy-to-anger communities:**
- SEO community - "super easy to piss off"
- UGC community - "super easy to piss off"

**Killed by compliance:**
> "Slash allows you to open unlimited virtual credit cards. Let's say you want to give your virtual assistant a card but don't want him spending your money on OnlyFans - block it, and Slash will automatically reject any of those hosts."

Got cut but was "ready to go" in edit. The willingness to experiment is key.

**The psychology:**
> "Go back to research. What do people complain about like traditional banking? Can't get on the phone with them and if you do it's like a thick ass Indian accent outsourced."

They're solving real complaints, just stating it provocatively.

### Phase 2: Influencer Campaign Build (Weeks 3-4)

#### Step 6: Recruit 30-100 Influencers

**Target numbers:**
- Small launch: 30-40 influencers
- Large launch: 70-100 influencers
- Average spend: $500-$3,000 per influencer
- Average cost: ~$1,000/person
- Total influencer budget: $50k-$100k

**Who to recruit:**

**Primary targets: Business owners in your niche**
> "You're not paying influencers. You're actually paying business owners in the niche to then talk about how this business affects them. So they're not traditional influencers, but they'll still take a paid post."

**Example (Meridian targeting ecom brands):**
- Ecom brand owners
- Marketing directors
- Agency owners
- People who run similar businesses

**Secondary targets: High engagement micro-influencers**
- 10k-30k followers is enough on Twitter
- Must have genuine audience engagement
- Look for "know, care, and love" signals

**What "know, care, and love" means:**
> "Are people commenting and being like 'Yo like another bomb, Jimmy. This is amazing. You're the man. I love you.' Do people know about Jimmy's personal life? All these different things that relate to influence and trust and then booking a demo from them."

**Example: Nick Shackleford**
> "People know his business inside and out. He talks about it all the time. He talks about a ton of tactical stuff. He talks about how much money he makes. He has people that know, trust, and love him. He's a high lever influencer that can book a lot of demos."

**Tertiary targets: Amplification accounts**
> "There's like a lot of like faceless accounts. Their purpose is just amplification. Like Chase Passive Income - he's just a shitposter, but he gets a lot of attention. Having five, 10, 15 accounts like that that you can plug in to a launch can really amplify."

**Pricing notes:**
- Crypto influencers: Most expensive
- Ecom influencers: Cheaper
- Average thread + LinkedIn post: $500-$3,000
- Payment terms: Negotiated rates for repeat work
- Matt has 100-150 influencers "in a Slack ready to go"

#### Step 7: Create Custom Content for Each Influencer

**The process:**

**Content team structure:**
1. Study each influencer's page
2. Identify their voice/style
3. Find viral post templates in niche
4. Write custom content for each person
5. Create visual assets for posts

**Content templates that work:**

**Template 1: "5 Ways I'll Use This"**
> "[Company] just launched [product] and it's insane. Here are five different ways we can use it at [my brand]."

**Example:** Nick Shackleford for MOI launch
- Puts it in practical terms for his business
- Shows real use cases
- Written by Matt's team, not Nick

**Template 2: "X vs Y Comparison"**
> "I tested [new product] vs [established alternative] with 20 different prompts. Here were the results."

**Why it works:** People always compare models (DeepSeek vs Gemini, etc.)

**Template 3: "Founder Story"**
> "This 23-year-old Stanford dropout raised $60 million and he's changing the banking world forever. Strap in."

**Why it works:**
- Founders love being glazed
- Acts as PR piece
- Builds credibility and intrigue
- Especially powerful if founder story is exceptional

**Template 4: "Pure Giveaway"**
> "Huge giveaway alert: [Brand] just launched and they're giving away [valuable resource]. Here's how to get it: [instructions]"

- Quote tweet the main launch post
- Straight value play
- No complex thread needed

**Template 5: "The Listicle"**
> "[Company] just launched their global business bank account that lets any operator open a US bank account without an LLC. Here are five of the craziest things that this changes: [numbered list]"

**Visual assets approach:**

**High-value influencers:**
- Custom designed assets
- Design team creates specifically for them
- Editing team makes unique graphics
- Matches their brand style

**Standard influencers:**
- "Out of the box" assets
- 20 different pre-made assets about product
- Plug and play into posts
- Still professional quality

**Content sourcing strategy:**
> "Everything we do is super tactical and it comes from a viral post out there that we've already seen. Validate that your giveaway is a good giveaway by copying a giveaway out there already that's tangential or in niche."

**The research process:**
1. Spend 10-20 hours seeing what everyone in space talks about
2. Find outliers (viral posts in niche)
3. Save those examples
4. Copy them for influencers
5. Plug and play your product into proven templates

**Result:**
> "Oftentimes our sponsored post on the influencers page does way better than their average post - way like leaps and bounds better."

#### Step 8: Organize Campaign Logistics

**The brutal reality:**
> "It is a shit ton of manual work. It is a shit ton of manual work. It is super fucking manual. A ton of VAs on it at any given time."

**Organization system:**
- Fat spreadsheet with tons of toggles
- Content draft links
- Payment terms
- Price tracking
- Post timing schedule
- Confirmation status

**Team structure:**
- VAs handling outreach
- Strategists reviewing posts
- Content writers drafting
- Designers creating assets
- Matt + team approving everything

**Pre-launch checklist per influencer:**
- ✅ Content written and approved
- ✅ Visual assets created
- ✅ Giveaway added to post
- ✅ Post time confirmed
- ✅ Payment terms agreed
- ✅ Influencer confirmed availability

**Timeline intensity:**
> "Coming up to a launch, it is intense. It's weekends, it's long hours, late nights. It's a lot of work in a concentrated period of time. It's a six week window where you're like boom and bust - all in these six weeks and then you're taking a few weeks off."

### Phase 3: Launch Day Execution (Day 0)

#### Step 9: Launch Video + Reply Protocol

**Posting the main video:**
- Goes on founder's account (typically)
- Timed for maximum audience availability
- Caption includes positioning + CTA
- First few minutes are critical

**The MOST important algorithm hack:**
> "Reply and then a reply back from the tweet author. This is one of the biggest pieces of sauce that no one fucking realizes that the X algo really really looks at - did the person reply and then did the tweet author reply back."

**The protocol:**
> "If you see a launch out there and you see all these replies and you don't see the author replying back, they massive miss. Massive miss. You need to reply to all of them. All of them."

**Why this matters:**

**X Algorithm - Two Sides:**

**1. Sourcing** - Will algo show your content at all?
- Biggest indicator: **Retweets**
- This is why giveaway requires retweet
- Gets you into "For You" feeds

**2. Ranking** - How high up will you appear?
- Biggest indicator: **Reply + reply back**
- Platform wants to incentivize engagement
- More engagement = more ad inventory

**Real world result:**
> "Any of our launches if you were in sort of niche of the launch it would have been one of the first or second things on your for you page on X and the reason is because they ranked very highly."

**Launch day roles:**
> "I'm sweating behind every time a launch. I'm sitting here glued refreshing every 3 seconds."

#### Step 10: Orchestrate Influencer Wave (1-2 Hours After Launch)

**Timing strategy:**
> "An hour or two hours after the launch goes live is when you want all of this to go out. All this stuff to go out."

**Why the delay:**
- Let core audience engage first
- Algorithm tests with core base
- Don't dilute with wrong audience early

**The timing risk:**
> "You put the wrong gas at the wrong time. If you take a massive theme page and you put that theme page on within 10 minutes of the post going live, you kind of get served to the wrong audience because you get people watching and then the algo looks and says 'Hmm, these people didn't engage very heavily because they're not like super core base.'"

**Algorithm progression:**
1. **Core follower base** - Did they engage standard or more?
2. **If more** - Send to second level
3. **Second level engagement test** - Still good?
4. **If yes** - Go broad

**Analogy to YouTube:**
> "When I launch podcast, I don't send external traffic from my email list or tweet the video for like two or three hours cuz I want my core base to have like its full experience first. Once I can optimize the title and thumbnail in three hours, then I'm going to email blast, tweet, and put on Instagram story."

**What influencers must do:**

**1. Post their main content thread**
- Pre-written by your team
- Custom for their audience
- Includes visual assets
- Has giveaway if applicable

**2. Repost the main launch**
- Quote tweet with commentary
- Direct retweet
- Both work depending on strategy

**3. Comment on main launch**
- Substantive comment
- Not just "Cool!"
- Add value or perspective

**4. Engage with each other**
> "You want to encourage them - and a lot of them will because we give them a ton of deals - to also engage with each other, to ping pong off of each other. They all engage with each other."

**Live management on launch day:**
> "You're playing a video game. It's like who's going to post when, who's going to repost when, we have some of those amplification pages, then we have Discords. You have to watch and you're like playing a video game. When am I going to put gas on? When am I going to take gas off?"

#### Step 11: Discord & Community Activation

**Additional amplification channel:**
> "If you get in Discords, that's super powerful. That's something we're trying to do - getting and tapping more of these Discords."

**Strategy:**
- Target relevant community Discords
- Crypto example: Slash targeted crypto Discords
- Create giveaways if members engage
- "If you engage [with the launch post], [you get giveaway]"

**Results:**
> "You could get like 200 retweets and comments on the post immediately."

**How to find:**
- Research where your audience hangs out
- Need connections to Discord admins
- Crypto communities particularly active
- Developer communities could work for dev tools

#### Step 12: Extra Engagement Tactics

**VAs responding to comments:**
> "I had my VAs on it all during the launch and if you go on that post you'll see a bunch of replies."

**Meridian tactic:**
> "People would just comment something. They wouldn't even comment the keyword which was 'meridian' for the giveaway, but like a big brand founder would comment and we went in and ran the thing for them and just replied with a screenshot and said like 'You need to do some work here.'"

**Why this works:**
- Public accountability
- Someone in their company sees it
- "Shit, that's my job. I was supposed to be doing that."
- Makes giveaway feel more valuable
- Creates social proof
- Other people want to get their score

**The note:**
> "That's a lot of work but those details matter. We should have even done more to be honest."

### Phase 4: Post-Launch Momentum (Days 1-3)

#### Step 13: Follow-Up Content

**The opportunity:**
> "You just got a ton of views. Your algorithm is hot. Your next video is obviously going to get a good amount of engagement. It kind of works in streaks like that. If you get good views on this post, the next one will probably start better and you have momentum."

**Slash follow-up example:**

**Option 1 (killed by compliance):**
> "The non-Mumbai was getting a ton of engagement. So I took a screenshot of Victor [founder], put it in a video, and it was going to be a side by side of Slash customer support versus your bank's customer support. Victor turns into an Indian guy answering the phone, then Slash customer support with some jacked dudes answering very professionally, just memeing."

**Option 2 (what shipped - Mason's idea):**
- AI-generated "Margot Robbie" style video
- Woman in bathtub with wine
- Fancy accent
- Explains Slash in everyday terms
- Got "another few million views"

**The principle:**
> "Think about what pieces of ammo do you have. Take all these pieces of ammo and use them."

**Types of ammunition:**
- Fundraising announcements
- Valuation milestones
- Domain purchases ("Slash.com for $1M")
- Exceptional team stats ("Average age 20")
- Personal achievements ("Everyone made $1M before joining")
- Technical innovations
- Notable investors/advisors
- Customer milestones

**Slash ammunition used:**
> "We're putting our money where our mouth is. We bought slash.com for a million dollars is a piece of ammo that got maybe an extra 50,000 impressions cuz there were people talking about it like 'Holy shit these guys are legit.'"

**Strategy:**
- Layer multiple pieces of ammo into one video
- Use most controversial/exceptional/remarkable details
- Break pattern from standard tech announcements
- "The tech industry is neutered. It's so vanilla."

#### Step 14: Maintain Engagement

**Continue replying to comments:**
- Don't stop after launch day
- Keep engaging for 48-72 hours
- Algorithm continues to boost engaged posts

**Deliver on giveaway promises:**
- Send lead magnets promptly
- Provide real value
- Over-deliver if possible
- Triggers reciprocity

**Monitor and adjust:**
- Watch which influencer posts perform best
- Can boost winners with additional engagement
- Learn what resonated for next launch

**Results to expect:**
- Demo calendar booked solid
- Weeks of calls scheduled
- Organic conversation continuing
- Media coverage potentially

**Meridian results:**
> "You should see his calendar. He had no AEs, no SDRs, nothing. His calendar was like for three weeks out just demo, demo, demo, demo, demo every 30 minutes."

**View targets:**
- 2-3M views: Good launch
- 5-7M views: Great launch
- 9-10M views: Exceptional (like Meridian)
- Views span: Main video + influencer posts + organic shares

## 3. Influencer Marketing Strategy - Deep Dive

### The Core Insight

**The biggest mistake everyone makes:**
> "The biggest misconception is that influencers will do a good job selling your product. Influencers can sell themselves, they can post for themselves, but as soon as you pay them to do something, they give you the biggest load of dog shit. They don't give a fuck."

**The solution:**
> "We actually take all of the content and we bring in a content team. Around a launch, we bring in a content team for every single influencer. They study the influencer's page and then they write content and make assets for that influencer."

### Influencer Identification Criteria

**What to look for:**

**1. Know, Care, and Love**
> "I look at people that have people that know care and love them. Those three things because that's influence in my opinion."

**How to identify:**
- Not just total likes
- Look at comment quality
- "Are people commenting and being like 'Yo another fucking bomb, Jimmy. This is amazing. You're the man. I love you.'"
- Do followers know about their personal life?
- Is there genuine connection?

**2. High Engagement Rate**
- Followers don't matter as much as engagement
- 10k-30k followers can be enough on Twitter
- Must be real people, not bots
- Look for consistent engagement patterns

**3. Target Demographic Alignment**
> "You're trying to find people who are in your target demographic. Who would be your customer to then tweet because obviously they have people that follow them that are in your customer base."

**4. Can Drive Demos**
> "This relates to influence and trust and then booking a demo from them."

**Example: Nick Shackleford**
- Big influencer in DTC community
- People know his business inside and out
- Talks about tactical stuff constantly
- Shares revenue numbers
- High trust = demo bookings

### Influencer Categories

**Category 1: Business Owners (Primary)**
- Own businesses in your niche
- Have firsthand product use cases
- Followers are similar business owners
- Content is authentic
- Can speak to ROI

**Meridian example:** Targeted ecom brand owners, not SEO professionals

**Category 2: Micro-Influencers (Secondary)**
- 10k-50k followers
- High engagement
- Know how to write engaging content
- Human beings who talk normally
- Not template/spam accounts

**Category 3: Amplification Pages (Tertiary)**
- Faceless accounts
- Large following
- Purpose is pure distribution
- Won't book demos but will boost reach
- Example: Chase Passive Income

**Category 4: Theme Pages**
- Use carefully and late
- Don't use in first 10 minutes
- Can dilute early algorithm signals
- Good for second wave (2-3 hours in)

### Compensation Structure

**Standard rates:**
- Thread + LinkedIn post: $500-$3,000
- Average: ~$1,000 per influencer
- Negotiated rates for repeat work
- Some on retainer in Slack

**Niche-specific pricing:**
- Crypto influencers: Most expensive
- Ecom influencers: Cheaper
- B2B SaaS: Mid-range

**What they get:**
- Payment (typically $500-$3k)
- Pre-written content
- Visual assets
- Sometimes additional giveaway opportunities
- Ongoing relationship for future launches

**Matt's advantage:**
> "At this point we have 100-150 of some really big people with negotiated rates just sitting in a Slack ready to go for our deals to come in."

### Content Creation Process

**Step 1: Study the influencer**
- Analyze their recent posts
- Identify voice/tone
- Note what performs well
- Understand their audience

**Step 2: Find viral templates**
- Research niche for viral posts
- Save best-performing examples
- "Everything comes from a viral post out there that we've already seen"
- Create library of proven formats

**Step 3: Adapt template to product**
- Take proven format
- Insert your product details
- Maintain structure that worked
- Customize for specific influencer

**Step 4: Match influencer voice**
- Write in their style
- Use their typical language
- Include their personality quirks
- Should feel authentic to them

**Step 5: Create visual assets**

**High-value influencers:**
- Custom design work
- Match their brand aesthetic
- Unique graphics/videos
- Premium treatment

**Standard influencers:**
- Pre-made asset library
- 20+ different options
- Professional quality
- Mix and match

**Step 6: Add giveaway element**
> "All of our launches - every influencer post has a giveaway in it. That's like a little check we have on our SOP before all these influencer posts go out."

**Benefits of this approach:**
- Gets virality on influencer posts too
- Not just main launch post
- Multiplies engagement
- Can use same or different giveaways

### What Influencers Must Deliver

**Deliverable 1: Main Content Thread**
- Pre-written by your team
- Posted at scheduled time
- Includes visual assets
- Has giveaway/lead magnet

**Deliverable 2: Engagement on Main Launch**
- Repost the main launch video
- Comment substantively on main post
- This is required, not optional

**Deliverable 3: Reply to Their Comments**
> "People replying to comments is big. So getting the creator to reply back to everyone that comments is big."

**Deliverable 4: Cross-Engagement**
- Engage with other influencers' posts
- Create ecosystem effect
- Ping pong off each other
- Amplifies across network

### Influencer Outreach Strategy

**Current state for Matt:**
- Established network of 100-150 ready
- Repeat business model
- Pre-negotiated rates
- Low friction

**For first-time launches:**
- Manual spreadsheet
- Cold outreach via DMs
- Reference successful examples
- Offer clear terms upfront

**Outreach message structure:**
1. Intro - who you are, what you're launching
2. Opportunity - why you're reaching out to them
3. Deliverables - what you need from them
4. Support - what you'll provide (content, assets)
5. Compensation - payment amount
6. Timing - when launch happens
7. Ask - are they interested?

### Quality Control

**How to ensure quality:**
1. You write everything (don't trust influencer)
2. Approve all content before posting
3. Provide all visual assets
4. Clear timing instructions
5. Confirm receipt and understanding

**Red flags to avoid:**
- Influencers who insist on writing own content
- Those who won't engage with your process
- Accounts with suspicious engagement
- Anyone not responsive to pre-launch coordination

### Success Metrics Per Influencer

**What to track:**
- Views on their post
- Engagement rate (likes, comments, retweets)
- Click-throughs to main launch
- Demo bookings (if trackable)
- Quality of audience engagement

**Expected results:**
> "Oftentimes our sponsored post on the influencers page does way better than their average post - way like leaps and bounds better."

**Why this happens:**
- Professional content team writing
- Proven viral templates
- Quality visual assets
- Giveaway driving engagement
- Strategic timing

## 4. Content Strategy

### The Copy Formula

**Core principle:**
> "No one gives a fuck about you. They care about what it's going to do for them."

**Common mistake:**
> "We have been working on this for 5 years. I'm super proud to announce. No one gives a fuck how hard our team has worked. Tell me right now what it's gonna do for me, what I will get out of this."

### The Positioning Framework

**Bad positioning (features):**
- "A tool that helps your brand get ranked better"
- "We built software to manage your analytics"
- "Our platform streamlines your workflow"

**Good positioning (outcomes + novelty):**
- "The world's first AI SEO team to get your brand ranked #1"
- "Make an extra $100,000 in 30 days"
- "Open a US bank account in 5 minutes without an LLC"

### Writing Principles

**1. Bold Claims**
> "How bold can we make a claim that is still defensible?"

**Examples:**
- "We raised $60 million" (social proof)
- "World's first" (novelty)
- "Increase revenue 32%" (specific outcome)
- "Without an LLC or EIN" (removes barrier)

**2. Novel Framing**

**AI prompt Matt uses:**
> "Make this sound more novel."

**What novelty means:**
- Cutting edge
- Revolutionary
- Never been done before
- The newest wave

**Example: ChatGPT**
> "OpenAI when they launch something they don't need to put anything behind it because what they're doing is cutting edge, it's the newest wave."

**3. Intensity**

**AI prompt Matt uses:**
> "Turn up the intensity."

**Example:**
- ❌ Low intensity: "My leg aches"
- ✅ High intensity: "There was a burning sensation in my leg"

**Example:**
- ❌ Low intensity: "We help your brand get recommended more"
- ✅ High intensity: "We get your brand ranked #1 by ChatGPT"

**4. Fifth Grade Reading Level**
> "If you say one word that someone doesn't understand they you lose them. They're gone."

**Mr. Beast principle:**
> "He doesn't say 'There is a room and there is money in the room.' He will say 'There's $5,000 inside this box that can be opened this way.' He explains it to such a level that anyone in the world could understand. It's impossible to misunderstand."

**5. Show Don't Tell**
> "Don't walk the viewer through how it does it in past tense or what it can do. No, in real time."

**Examples:**
- ❌ "MOI can do X" (past tense)
- ✅ "Right now MOI is scanning through billions of sites" (present tense)

**6. One-to-One Audio/Visual Match**
> "Good video making is the audio and the visual line up one to one. If you watch a Mr. Beast video, what you're saying matches what you're seeing. Exactly. And the closer they match, the better the video."

### Content Types for Influencers

**Type 1: Personal Use Cases**
- "Here are 5 ways I'll use [product] at [my company]"
- Makes it practical and tangible
- Shows real-world application
- Written by your team, posted by them

**Type 2: Comparison Posts**
- "I tested [new tool] vs [old tool] with 20 prompts"
- People love comparisons
- Validates your product
- Creates FOMO

**Type 3: Founder Story**
- "[Founder] raised $X to change [industry]"
- Builds credibility
- Creates intrigue
- PR value for founder

**Type 4: Listicles**
- "5 craziest things this changes"
- Easy to consume
- High engagement format
- Proven template

**Type 5: Pure Giveaway**
- "Get [valuable resource] if you [action]"
- Direct value play
- Forces engagement
- Lead capture

### Visual Asset Strategy

**For launch video:**
- Professional production quality
- Tight editing (every second counts)
- Animations to visualize abstract concepts
- Computer vision effects for AI/scanning
- Mr. Beast-level audio/visual alignment

**For influencer posts:**

**High-value influencers:**
- Custom designed
- Matches their brand
- Unique graphics
- Premium feel

**Standard influencers:**
- Asset library (20+ options)
- Mix and match
- Professional quality
- Plug and play

**Asset types:**
- Screenshots with annotations
- Charts/graphs showing results
- Before/after comparisons
- Feature highlights
- Founder photos
- Product interface demos
- Custom graphics

### Lead Magnet Design

**Must-have elements:**

**1. Immediate value**
- Useful right away
- No complex setup
- Quick win

**2. Problem awareness**
- Shows them their issue
- Makes problem concrete
- Creates urgency

**3. Low barrier to entry**
- Simple to access
- Quick to use
- No commitment required

**4. Natural product funnel**
- Leads to full product
- Demonstrates capability
- Creates desire for more

**5. Viral potential**
> "Can this be something that's viral and people talk about?"

**Meridian example:**
- Free SEO scoring tool
- Enter domain
- Get score (0-100)
- See specific weaknesses
- View competitors' rankings
- CTA to full product

**Why it worked:**
- Immediately useful
- Made problem visible
- Easy to share scores
- Could even respond to non-keyword comments with scores
- Public accountability angle

**Validation method:**
> "Validate that your giveaway is a good giveaway by copying a giveaway out there already that's tangential or in niche that's already proven."

### The Rage Bait Strategy

**Philosophy:**
> "There's no nuance allowed on Twitter. You have to have bold claims. You need to be polarized. You need to be on the edge of controversy without getting cancelled."

**How to do it:**

**1. Target easy-to-anger communities**
- SEO community
- UGC community
- Find niche-specific sacred cows

**2. Make it subtle**
> "That little subtle thing that you throw in that like almost gets brushed over, but then gets someone to be like 'Wait, was that real? Did he just say that?'"

**3. Root it in real customer research**
- Base it on actual complaints
- Solve real problems
- Just state it provocatively

**4. Don't apologize**
- Own the statement
- Some people will be mad
- That's the point

**Examples:**

**Slash: "Non-Mumbai 24/7 support"**
- Communicates premium support
- References common pain point
- Culturally relevant
- Some Indians got mad
- Massive distribution

**Meridian: Pissing off SEO community**
- Positioned as replacing them
- They raged in comments
- Distributed post for free
- Reached actual targets (brand owners)

**What got killed: OnlyFans line**
> "Slash allows you to block virtual assistants from spending on OnlyFans."
- Too edgy for compliance
- But shows willingness to experiment

### Writing Process

**Step 1: Research**
- 10-20 hours studying niche
- What does audience talk about?
- What are current pain points?
- What's trending/meta?

**Step 2: Position**
- Find novel angle
- Identify bold claim
- Ensure defensible

**Step 3: Draft script**
- Bold claim opening
- Wow moments demonstration
- Optional social proof
- Lead magnet CTA

**Step 4: Intensify**
- Run through "make more novel" AI prompt
- Run through "turn up intensity" AI prompt
- Remove nuance
- Simplify language

**Step 5: Validate**
- Does it pass the "5th grade test"?
- Is every word necessary?
- Could anyone misunderstand?
- Does audio match visual?

**Step 6: Add controversy**
- Where can you toe the line?
- What will make people say "wait, what?"
- Is it defensible?

## 8. Key Insights & Insider Secrets

### The Core Philosophy

**Distribution > Creation**
> "When most people see a launch, they see the main video and think that's it. And so when people come to me, the biggest misconception is like we just need a video and then we're going to go launch it and push it out there. But really the more important part is the distribution around the video."

**The nightclub model works:**
- Pay promoters to bring crowd
- Early momentum signals quality
- Algorithm amplifies success
- Organic growth follows

### Insider Secret #1: Influencers Can't Write

**The revelation:**
> "The biggest misconception is that influencers will do a good job selling your product. That is the biggest misconception. Influencers can sell themselves, they can post for themselves, but as soon as you pay them to do something, they give you the biggest load of dog shit."

**What this means:**
- You must write everything
- Study their voice
- Create their assets
- Don't trust them to do it

**Why most campaigns fail:**
- Pay influencer, let them create
- They half-ass it
- Content sucks
- Waste of money

**Matt's approach:**
- Full content team
- Custom content per influencer
- Professional assets
- Proven templates

### Insider Secret #2: The Reply-Back Algorithm Hack

**The single biggest algorithm signal:**
> "This is one of the biggest pieces of sauce that no one fucking realizes that the X algo really really looks at - the person reply and then did the tweet author reply back."

**What most people do wrong:**
> "If you see a launch out there and you see all these replies and you don't see the author replying back, they massive miss. Massive miss."

**The requirement:**
- Reply to ALL comments
- Not some, ALL
- This isn't optional
- It's the difference between 500k and 5M views

**Why it works:**
- Platform wants engagement
- More engagement = more ad inventory
- They reward creators who engage
- Creates conversation loops

### Insider Secret #3: Timing the Influencer Wave

**The mistake:**
> "You put the wrong gas at the wrong time. If you take a massive theme page and you put that theme page on within 10 minutes of the post going live, you kind of get served to the wrong audience."

**How algorithms work:**
1. Send to core followers first
2. Measure their engagement
3. If above average, expand
4. Test second circle
5. If still good, go broad

**The strategy:**
- Let core audience engage first (1-2 hours)
- Then activate influencers
- Stagger for maximum effect
- Save big pages for later

**Matt's approach:**
> "You're playing a video game. It's like who's going to post when, who's going to repost when. You have to watch and you're like when am I going to put gas on? When am I going to take gas off?"

### Insider Secret #4: Novelty Is Everything

**Why most launches fail:**
> "The biggest indicator of whether a launch is going to be successful or not is how you position what you're launching. Does it feel novel?"

**What novelty means:**
- Revolutionary
- Never been done
- Cutting edge
- The newest wave

**OpenAI example:**
> "OpenAI when they launch something they don't need to put anything behind it because what they're doing is cutting edge."

**For everyone else:**
- Find the novel angle
- "World's first X"
- Position as breakthrough
- Create FOMO

**The test:**
- Does this feel new?
- Would I share this?
- Is this the "next thing"?

### Insider Secret #5: Copy What Works

**Don't reinvent the wheel:**
> "Everything we do is super tactical and it comes from a viral post out there that we've already seen."

**The process:**
1. Find viral posts in niche
2. Save best examples
3. Copy structure exactly
4. Plug in your product
5. Distribute through influencers

**Why this works:**
- Already validated
- Proven format
- Less risk
- Faster execution

**For giveaways:**
> "Validate that your giveaway is a good giveaway by copying a giveaway out there already that's tangential or in niche that's already proven."

### Insider Secret #6: The Tech Industry Is Neutered

**The opportunity:**
> "The tech industry is neutered. It's so vanilla."

**What everyone does:**
- "We are here today to change the world"
- "Drive massive impact"
- Fluffy buzzwords
- Safe, boring positioning

**What works:**
- Controversial statements
- Bold claims
- Rage bait
- Personality

**Example: Non-Mumbai support**
- Levels.io quote tweeted
- Massive distribution
- Some people mad
- That's the point

**The edge:**
> "If you can just be willing to toe the line a little bit, you can do very well."

### Insider Secret #7: Founders Are Selfish (And That's the Problem)

**The mistake:**
> "Everyone's selfish. Everyone wants to talk about themselves. These founders like everyone always wants to make it about them, about what they did, about their background."

**What users actually want:**
> "No one gives a fuck about you. They care about what it's going to do for them."

**Common bad intros:**
- "We have been working on this for 5 years"
- "I'm super proud to announce"
- "Our team has worked so hard"

**Good intros:**
- "Here's what this will do for you"
- "You can now [achieve outcome]"
- "World's first [novel thing]"

**The hard part:**
> "The problem is everyone always thinks that they can [write good copy] and everyone always thinks that their way is the best and it creates tension especially on bigger teams."

### Insider Secret #8: Ammunition Matters

**What is ammunition:**
> "Sit there and think like what is unique? What is revolutionary about your company that's a piece of ammo?"

**Examples of ammunition:**
- Fundraising amount ("We raised $60M")
- Valuation
- Domain purchase ("Slash.com for $1M")
- Team stats ("Average age 20")
- Personal achievements ("Everyone made $1M before joining")
- Investor names
- Customer logos
- Technical breakthroughs

**How to use it:**
> "Take all this ammo together and unleash it at once."

**Slash example:**
> "We're putting our money where our mouth is. We bought slash.com for a million dollars is a piece of ammo that got maybe an extra 50,000 impressions."

### Insider Secret #9: The Follow-Up Momentum Play

**The opportunity:**
> "You just got a ton of views. Your algorithm is hot. Your next video is obviously going to get a good amount of engagement. It kind of works in streaks."

**What to do:**
- Post day 2 content
- Ride the momentum
- Use different angles
- Can be more experimental

**Slash example:**
- Main launch: 3M views
- Follow-up (AI Margot Robbie): "Another few million views"
- Total amplification continues

**Types of follow-up:**
- Behind the scenes
- Meme versions
- User testimonials
- Feature deep-dives

### Insider Secret #10: Manual Work Can't Be Avoided

**The reality:**
> "It is a shit ton of manual work. It is super fucking manual. A ton of VAs on it at any given time."

**What can't be automated:**
- Influencer outreach
- Custom content creation
- Campaign coordination
- Live launch management
- Engagement responses

**The tool:**
> "It's like a fat spreadsheet with a ton of toggles, content draft links, payment terms, price."

**Could it be automated?:**
> "I probably could spend time and automate and I probably should. We're just like, you know, we got a lot going on and I haven't done it."

**The truth:**
- High-touch service
- Details matter
- Automation loses quality
- Worth the manual effort

### Insider Secret #11: Intensity Beats Everything

**The AI prompt:**
> "Turn up the intensity."

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Help your brand get recommended"
- ✅ "Get your brand ranked #1"

- ❌ "My leg aches"
- ✅ "Burning sensation in my leg"

- ❌ "We built a banking platform"
- ✅ "We raised $60M to build the world's first..."

**Why it works:**
- Vivid language
- Specific outcomes
- Creates urgency
- Impossible to ignore

### Insider Secret #12: The Lead Magnet Is Non-Negotiable

**Why it matters:**
> "We know we need algorithmically a lot of people at a high percentage to repost the video and comment on the video. So how do we do that? We dangle a carrot in front of their face."

**What it accomplishes:**
1. Forces retweets (algo sourcing)
2. Forces comments (algo ranking)
3. Captures emails (lead gen)
4. Demonstrates problem (awareness)
5. Builds trust (reciprocity)

**The requirement:**
- Must be valuable
- Must be proven
- Must be easy
- Must lead to product

**Matt's estimate:**
> "Adding the lead magnet I am very confident adds at least 30% more views to the launch."

At scale (1M views), that's 300k+ additional views from one tactic.

### Insider Secret #13: Communities Are Underutilized

**The Discord strategy:**
> "If you get in Discords, that's super powerful. That's something we're trying to do - getting and tapping more of these Discords."

**How it works:**
- Find relevant community Discords
- Create giveaway for engagement
- "If you engage with the launch post, you get X"
- Can get 200+ retweets/comments immediately

**Where to find:**
- Crypto communities (very active)
- Developer communities
- Niche professional groups
- Product-specific communities

**Slash example:**
- Targeted crypto Discords
- Made sense for international banking
- Massive immediate engagement

### Insider Secret #14: Pre-Commit Your Influencers

**Matt's advantage:**
> "At this point we have 100-150 of some really big people with negotiated rates just sitting in a Slack ready to go."

**What this means:**
- Pre-negotiated rates
- Established relationships
- Quick turnaround
- Reliable execution

**How to build this:**
- Start with smaller campaigns
- Build relationships
- Deliver value to influencers
- Create repeat business model
- Eventually have network on standby

### Insider Secret #15: Fifth Grade Rule

**The principle:**
> "If you say one word that someone doesn't understand they you lose them. They're gone."

**Mr. Beast standard:**
> "He explains it to such a level that anyone in the world could understand. It's impossible to misunderstand."

**What this means:**
- No jargon
- No complex words
- No technical terms
- Crystal clear

**Real example:**
- ❌ "Agentic system" (Matt wouldn't use)
- ✅ "AI that makes you $100k"

**The test:**
- Would a 5th grader understand?
- Could your grandma explain it back?
- Is there ANY ambiguity?

- Algorithm timing is crucial

**But remember:**
> "It is a shit ton of manual work. It is super fucking manual. A ton of VAs on it at any given time."

This is what separates successful launches from failures - willingness to do the manual work.

### The Opportunity

The tech industry is "neutered" - safe, boring, vanilla. There's a massive opportunity for anyone willing to:
- Be slightly controversial
- Make bold claims
- Focus on outcomes
- Orchestrate distribution

DebugLayer can stand out by following this playbook exactly while adapting for developer credibility.

### Final Quote

> "Coming up to a launch, it is intense. It's weekends, it's long hours, late nights. It's a lot of work in a concentrated period of time. It's a six week window where you're like boom and bust - all in these six weeks and then you're taking a few weeks off."

**The question is: Are you willing to do the work?**

If yes, you have the playbook. Now execute.
