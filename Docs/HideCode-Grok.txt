Yes, you can convert HTML files into standalone .exe executables (for Windows), and easily create multiple like file1.exe, file2.exe, file3.exe. This bundles your HTML/JS/CSS into apps that run offline without a browser, hiding the source code somewhat (though not fully secure against reverse-engineering). Electron is the most straightforward tool for this—it's free, cross-platform, and beginner-friendly.
Quick Steps Using Electron

Setup Environment (one-time):
Install Node.js from nodejs.org (if not already).
In a new project folder, run in terminal/cmd:textnpm init -y
npm install electron --save-dev

For Each HTML File (e.g., file1.html):
Create a subfolder for each (e.g., file1-app).
Copy file1.html into it.
Add main.js in the subfolder:JavaScriptconst { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron');

function createWindow() {
  const win = new BrowserWindow({ width: 800, height: 600 });
  win.loadFile('file1.html');  // Replace with your HTML filename
}

app.whenReady().then(createWindow);
app.on('window-all-closed', () => { if (process.platform !== 'darwin') app.quit(); });
Update package.json in the subfolder (add under "scripts"):JSON"start": "electron .",
"package": "electron-builder"
Install builder: npm install electron-builder --save-dev
Add to package.json "build" section:JSON"build": {
  "appId": "com.yourname.file1",
  "productName": "File1 App",
  "win": { "target": "nsis" }
}

Build the .exe:
Run npm run package—outputs file1.exe in dist/ (repeat for file2/file3 in their folders).

Test & Distribute:
Run npm start to preview.
Share the .exes—they launch your HTML as apps.


Alternatives: NW.js (simpler for pure HTML) or Tauri (lighter, Rust-based). For your story test, this creates portable apps while obscuring code—perfect for sharing without raw HTML exposure.
