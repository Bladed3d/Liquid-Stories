Hi, it's Clyde here, your vibe coding guru. One shot coding is AWESOME! Just tell AI what you want, boom, millionaire app in 10 minutes. It works everytime... except for when it doesn't. And then you spend days debugging and cursing at AI... lots of cursing. Use DebugLayer. DebugLayer is like window sensors for your code. We detect breaks. But we can't see inside. Less cursing. More gaming - and code that actually works. 

Vibe Coding is fun, creative, and cool.
But then AI proclaims it is working and it doesn't.
We tell AI what to fix.
