**The Truth:**
- "Free unlimited" applies ONLY to **paid subscribers** who sign up before November 27, 2025
- Free tier users get: 2 video mins/week, 1 AI credit/week, 4 exports/week with watermark
- Free tier has **NO access to generative features** (confirmed on pricing page)

#### Is This Misleading? YES.

**Evidence from Trustpilot Reviews:**

**User Complaint 1:**
> "False advertising - 'Unlimited Members' only means that we could work on the same project one after another. Completely useless for business purposes"

**User Complaint 2:**
> "Fraudulent, misleading scam - they keep asking you to add more credits or upgrade to fix and make the video 'usable'"

**User Complaint 3:**
> "Like a bait-and-switch - hit a paywall after trying to edit"

**InVideo's Response:**
> "Features like generative AI (which creates media from scratch) require credits due to the high processing involved. We never aim to mislead"

#### What's Actually Available

**Free Tier Reality:**
- 2 video minutes per week
- 1 AI credit per week (essentially nothing)
- 4 exports per week with watermark
- NO generative features
- NO Nano Banana access

**Paid Tiers for "Unlimited" Nano Banana 2:**
- Must sign up before November 27, 2025

**VERDICT: RECOMMENDED - $8/month for commercial rights and 500 songs is excellent value. Generate 15-20 four-minute tracks, stitch together for 60-minute videos. Fast, affordable, good quality.**

---

#### Udio AI

**Pricing (November 2025):**
- **Standard:** $10/month, 2,400 credits
- **Pro:** $30/month, 6,000 credits

**Features:**
- 30-second segments, extend incrementally
- Under 30 seconds generation time
- Clean, stable instrumentals
- Covers broad range: orchestral, ambient, jazz, EDM

**For Ambient Music:**
- "Produces clean, stable instrumentals that work well as background"
- "Can feel repetitive after heavy use"
- "Better for ambient instrumentals" (vs. Suno's vocal strength)
- After 90-120 seconds, flow can break (requires manual editing)

**Legal Status:**
- **Settled with Universal Music Group** (October 30, 2025)
- First major licensing deal in AI music generation
- Developing new platform with licensed music training
- Downloads/exports temporarily paused during licensing transition (November 2025)

**Commercial Licensing:**
- More generous free-tier commercial rights than Suno
- BUT: Recent settlement creates uncertainty
- Export pause is concerning for production workflows

**VERDICT: WAIT AND SEE. The Universal settlement is positive long-term, but the temporary export pause makes this unreliable for current production. Udio might be better for ambient instrumentals than Suno, but not worth the risk right now.**

---

#### Mubert AI

**Pricing (Unknown - search didn't return details):**
- Free tier with limitations
- Paid tiers for longer durations

**Features:**
- **Continuous streaming:** Unlimited ambient music
- **"Endless Stream"** feature for real-time generation
- Max track length: 25 minutes (paid), longer on enterprise
- **Most popular genres:** Lo-Fi, Ambient, Chill (PERFECT for your use case)
- API available

**For Ambient Music:**
- "Infinite, royalty-free music streams"
- "Generates music in real-time"
- "Well-suited for streams, shows, interviews, podcasts"
- **100 million AI tracks generated** (proven platform)

**Commercial Licensing:**
- Royalty-free music for projects
- Check pricing page for tier-specific rights

**VERDICT: MOST PROMISING for continuous ambient music. The 25-minute limit covers large chunks of your 60-minute videos, and Endless Stream for backgrounds. INVESTIGATE PRICING - this could be your best option if affordable.**

---

#### Alternative: Soundful

**Features:**
- Genre selection (trap, house, acoustic, etc.)
- "Studio-quality music"
- "Like it was pulled straight from a Netflix drama or Spotify Focus playlist"
- "No AI sound glitches, no awkward loops"
- Robust free tier, affordable premium

**For Ambient Music:**
- Not specifically designed for long-form ambient
- Better for "clean, polished tracks" with structure
- May not suit continuous ambient backgrounds

**VERDICT: Good for structured music, but Mubert likely better for ambient.**

---

#### Alternative: BandLab SongStarter

**Features:**
- "Best AI music generator" (marketing)
- Only 11 genres (hip hop, lofi, pop, etc.)
- Song starters, not long-form
- Entry-level AI music creator

**VERDICT: NOT SUITABLE for hour-long ambient tracks. Designed for song creation, not continuous backgrounds.**

---

#### Recommendation: Music Generation

**Primary:** **Suno Pro ($8/month)**
- Generate 15-20 four-minute ambient tracks
- Stitch together in Kdenlive/After Effects
- Commercial rights included
- Fast, affordable, reliable

**Investigate:** **Mubert (pricing TBD)**
- If affordable, use for continuous ambient backgrounds
- 25-minute tracks reduce stitching work
- Endless Stream for real-time generation
- Check commercial licensing details

**Avoid:**
- **Udio** (temporary export pause, uncertainty)
- **BandLab** (not designed for long-form)
- **Soundful** (better for structured music)

**Workflow:**
1. Generate 60-90 minutes of ambient music with Suno (15-20 tracks)
2. Create variations and themes per video
3. Stitch in DAW or video editor
4. Layer with ambient sounds (rain, wind, etc.) for depth

**VERDICT: Suno Pro at $8/month is the clear winner. Simple, affordable, commercial rights, proven platform. Mubert is worth investigating as a potential upgrade if pricing is reasonable.**

## Critical Questions Answered

### 1. Is ComfyUI + 4090 sufficient or should he invest in cloud services?

**Answer: HYBRID APPROACH IS OPTIMAL**

**ComfyUI + RTX 4090 is sufficient for 80% of your needs:**
- Wan2.2 Fun Camera is EXCELLENT for ambient fly-throughs
- LTX Video for fast iteration and testing
- Unlimited generation at $0 per video
- Full control over workflow and privacy

**But supplement with selective cloud for 20%:**
- Higgsfield ($17.40/month Black Friday deal) for Sora 2 access on hero shots
- Sora 2 provides best-in-class photorealism for key sequences
- 600 credits/month = 30-60 high-quality clips

**Why hybrid wins:**
- Local = unlimited volume + zero cost
- Cloud = top-tier quality when it matters
- Total cost stays low ($25-45/month)
- Best of both worlds

**Don't invest in:**
- Runway ($76/month for Unlimited) - too expensive, local is better
- ChatGPT Pro ($200/month for Sora) - Higgsfield cheaper access
- Pika (weak at cinematic) - not suitable for ambient videos

---

### 2. Which Black Friday deals are actually worth it?

**WORTH IT:**

**1. Higgsfield AI - 65% OFF (URGENT - ENDS TODAY)**
- **Value:** $17.40/month for Sora 2 + Veo 3.1 + Wan 2.5 access
